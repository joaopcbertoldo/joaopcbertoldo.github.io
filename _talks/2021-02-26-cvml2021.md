I lectured about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied in a use case of semantic segmentation with a composite material tomography.

The lecture was focused on the construction of a NN architecture for this image-to-image problem as part of the [`Computer vision and machine learning for the material scientist (CVML) 2021`](https://bigmeca.minesparis.psl.eu/cvml-2021/) week-long course at the Materials Center of MINES ParisTech - PSL University.
